## Introduction

You know those magic gameplay videos where you can see what cards people have in hand? Those name plates are painstakingly cropped out from card images and edited in manually by video editors.

This project aims to eliminate that tedium by generating name plate images for you (or even entire hands).

## CLI

This CLI is the proof of concept for this app.

### Usage

```sh
cargo run -- -c='Hello, world!' -t=templates/blue.png -o=hello.png
```

See help:

```sh
cargo run -- -h
```
